#### NOTE 1

Null Value Checking
There are no null values in adspend.csv,installs.csv,payouts.csv,revenue.csv
```python
print(adspend.isnull().values.any()) -> False
print(installs.isnull().values.any()) -> False
print(payouts.isnull().values.any()) -> False
print(revenue.isnull().values.any()) -> False
```
####Duplication Check:<br>
**For Adspending** there is no duplication<br><br>
**For Payouts and Revenue**, there are duplicate data but there are also different payout prices for the same day and the same installation_id.<br>
That means there can be many payouts or revenues for the same day so, duplications should not be removed <br><br>
**For Installation:**<br>
There is only one duplication in the installs data frame<br>
If duplicated data is generated by a mistake, it can be removed.<br>
However, in another scenario installing the same app twice on the same day, network, country, and os. might be the reason for duplication.<br>To test this scenario we need to check if there is any different installation ID generation under the same conditions.<br>

```python
print("installs.loc[(installs['country_id']==1) & (installs['app_id']==71)& (installs['network_id']==60) & (installs['event_date']=='2022-08-20') & (installs['device_os_version']=='12') ])
```

For an example input we can see that under the same conditions, different installation IDs are also generated. So yes the duplication in the installs data frame is a mistake.<br>
